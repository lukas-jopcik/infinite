# Story 2.5: Image Processing Pipeline

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want to** automatically process and optimize images from external sources  
**So that** images load fast and look great on all devices  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Image download from external sources
- [x] Multiple size generation (OG, hero, card, thumb)
- [x] WebP conversion with quality optimization (with fallback to JPEG)
- [x] S3 upload with proper naming
- [x] Alt text generation
- [x] Error handling for failed downloads

## Dev Notes
This story implements the image processing pipeline that downloads images from APOD and ESA Hubble sources, processes them using Sharp library, converts to WebP format, generates multiple sizes for different use cases, and uploads them to S3. The processed images will be used by the frontend for optimal performance.

## Tasks
- [x] **Task 2.5.1**: Implement image download functionality from external sources
- [x] **Task 2.5.2**: Add Sharp library for image processing and WebP conversion
- [x] **Task 2.5.3**: Generate multiple image sizes (OG, hero, card, thumbnail)
- [x] **Task 2.5.4**: Upload optimized images to S3 with proper naming
- [x] **Task 2.5.5**: Add alt text generation for images
- [x] **Task 2.5.6**: Implement error handling for failed downloads
- [x] **Task 2.5.7**: Test end-to-end image processing pipeline
