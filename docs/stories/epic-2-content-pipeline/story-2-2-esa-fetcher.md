# Story 2.2: ESA Hubble Data Fetcher

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Content Generation Pipeline
- **Story ID**: 2.2
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Draft

## Story
**As a** content manager  
**I want to** automatically fetch weekly ESA Hubble data from RSS feed  
**So that** we have additional astronomy content for article generation  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ESA fetcher Lambda function implemented
- [x] RSS feed parsing and data extraction
- [x] Data validation and error handling
- [x] Raw content stored in DynamoDB
- [x] Duplicate detection implemented
- [x] Scheduled execution via EventBridge (weekly)
- [x] CloudWatch monitoring and alerts

## Dev Notes
This story implements the ESA Hubble data fetcher that will run weekly to collect astronomy content from ESA's Hubble Picture of the Week RSS feed. The function should parse RSS XML, extract image and description data, and store raw content for processing.

## Tasks
- [x] **Task 2.2.1**: Implement ESA fetcher Lambda function
- [x] **Task 2.2.2**: Add RSS feed parsing and data extraction
- [x] **Task 2.2.3**: Implement data validation and duplicate detection
- [x] **Task 2.2.4**: Store raw content in DynamoDB
- [x] **Task 2.2.5**: Set up EventBridge scheduled rule (weekly)
- [x] **Task 2.2.6**: Add CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
- [x] **Task 2.2.7**: Test end-to-end ESA fetching
