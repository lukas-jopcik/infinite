# Story 2.1: APOD Data Fetcher

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Content Generation Pipeline
- **Story ID**: 2.1
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Draft

## Story
**As a** content manager  
**I want to** automatically fetch daily APOD data from NASA API  
**So that** we have fresh astronomy content for article generation  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] APOD fetcher Lambda function implemented
- [x] NASA API integration working
- [x] Data validation and error handling
- [x] Raw content stored in DynamoDB
- [x] Duplicate detection implemented
- [x] Scheduled execution via EventBridge
- [x] CloudWatch monitoring and alerts

## Dev Notes
This story implements the APOD data fetcher that will run daily to collect fresh astronomy content from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. The function should handle API rate limits, data validation, and store raw content for processing.

## Tasks
- [x] **Task 2.1.1**: Implement APOD fetcher Lambda function
- [x] **Task 2.1.2**: Add NASA API integration and error handling
- [x] **Task 2.1.3**: Implement data validation and duplicate detection
- [x] **Task 2.1.4**: Store raw content in DynamoDB
- [x] **Task 2.1.5**: Set up EventBridge scheduled rule
- [x] **Task 2.1.6**: Add CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
- [x] **Task 2.1.7**: Test end-to-end APOD fetching
