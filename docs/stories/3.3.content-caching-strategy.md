## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Epic 1 Complete:** AWS project is established with eu-central-1 region, AWS CLI is configured, basic infrastructure is set up (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch), NASA API integration is enhanced with RSS feed support, and basic AI service integration is implemented.
**From Epic 2 Complete:** AI content generation pipeline is implemented with Slovak content generation, SEO keyword generation, content quality validation, and complete content processing pipeline.
**From Story 3.1:** DynamoDB content storage is implemented with proper schema, indexing, and data access layer for APOD content storage.
**From Story 3.2:** S3 image caching is implemented with image optimization, CDN integration, and performance optimization for NASA APOD images.

### Data Models
**Content Cache Schema:**
- **Cache Key Structure:** `content:{apodDate}:{contentType}:{version}`
- **Cache Data:**
  - `cacheKey` (String) - Unique cache identifier
  - `apodDate` (String) - APOD date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `contentType` (String) - "article", "keywords", "seo", "metadata"
  - `contentData` (Object) - Cached content data
  - `contentHash` (String) - Content hash for integrity validation
  - `createdAt` (String) - ISO timestamp of cache creation
  - `expiresAt` (String) - ISO timestamp of cache expiration
  - `lastAccessed` (String) - ISO timestamp of last access
  - `accessCount` (Number) - Number of times accessed
  - `hitCount` (Number) - Number of cache hits
  - `missCount` (Number) - Number of cache misses
  - `cacheSize` (Number) - Cache entry size in bytes
  - `ttl` (Number) - Time to live in seconds

**Cache Invalidation Rules:**
- **Content Update:** Invalidate when APOD content is updated
- **Quality Improvement:** Invalidate when content quality is improved
- **SEO Update:** Invalidate when SEO keywords are updated
- **TTL Expiration:** Invalidate when TTL expires
- **Manual Invalidation:** Invalidate for manual content refresh

### API Specifications
**Cache Operations:**
- **Get:** `getCachedContent(cacheKey)` - Retrieve cached content
- **Set:** `setCachedContent(cacheKey, contentData, ttl)` - Store content in cache

- **Clear:** `clearCache(pattern)` - Clear cache entries by pattern
- **Stats:** `getCacheStats()` - Get cache performance statistics

**Cache Management Functions:**
- `cacheContent(apodDate, contentType, contentData)` - Cache content with TTL
- `getCachedContent(apodDate, contentType)` - Retrieve cached content
- `invalidateContentCache(apodDate, contentType)` - Invalidate content cache
- `refreshContentCache(apodDate, contentType)` - Refresh content cache
- `getCachePerformance()` - Get cache performance metrics
- `optimizeCachePerformance()` - Optimize cache performance
