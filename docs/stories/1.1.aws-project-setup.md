# Story 1.1: AWS Project Setup and Region Configuration

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a new AWS project with proper region selection for Slovakia,
**so that** I have optimal performance and compliance for Slovak users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. New AWS project is created with appropriate naming convention
2. AWS region is set to Europe (Frankfurt) eu-central-1 for optimal performance from Slovakia
3. AWS CLI is configured with the new project credentials
4. Project-specific IAM roles and policies are created
5. Billing alerts are configured for cost monitoring
6. Project setup is documented with region selection rationale

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context is available.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this story as it focuses on AWS infrastructure setup.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints are implemented in this story. This story establishes the foundation for future API development.

### Component Specifications
No frontend components are created in this story. This story focuses on AWS infrastructure setup.

### File Locations
Based on the architecture document, the following files will be created:
- `aws/config/environments/development.yaml` - Development environment configuration
- `aws/config/environments/production.yaml` - Production environment configuration
- `aws/config/policies/` - IAM policies directory
- `docs/aws-setup.md` - AWS setup documentation
- `docs/region-selection.md` - Region selection rationale

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test File Location:** `tests/aws/` directory for AWS infrastructure tests
- **Test Standards:** Infrastructure validation tests using AWS CLI commands
- **Testing Frameworks:** AWS CLI validation, CloudFormation template validation
- **Specific Testing Requirements:**
  - Verify AWS CLI authentication works
  - Validate region configuration is correct
  - Test IAM role permissions
  - Verify billing alerts are functional
  - Test basic AWS service access (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch)

### Technical Constraints
- **AWS Region:** Must use eu-central-1 (Europe - Frankfurt) for optimal performance from Slovakia
- **Cost Optimization:** Must stay within AWS free-tier limits where possible
- **Security:** Must implement least-privilege access for IAM roles
- **Documentation:** All setup must be documented for team members
- **Compliance:** Must ensure GDPR compliance for EU region deployment

## Testing
### Required Testing Approach
Infrastructure validation testing using AWS CLI commands and CloudFormation template validation.

### Key Test Scenarios
1. AWS CLI authentication and region access
2. IAM role permissions validation
3. Billing alerts functionality
4. Basic AWS service access verification
5. Region performance testing from Slovakia

### Success Criteria
- AWS CLI successfully authenticates and lists services in eu-central-1 region
- IAM roles have appropriate permissions for project services
- Billing alerts are configured and functional
- All AWS services are accessible in the correct region
- Documentation is complete and accurate

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test region performance from Slovakia location
- Validate GDPR compliance for EU region
- Verify cost monitoring is working correctly
- Test IAM security policies are properly configured
