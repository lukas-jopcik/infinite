  - [ ] Test both daily and historical content fetching

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** AWS project is created with eu-central-1 region selection, IAM roles and policies are established, billing alerts are configured.
**From Story 1.2:** AWS CLI is configured with proper credentials, environment setup is complete, service access is verified.
**From Story 1.3:** Basic AWS infrastructure is set up with Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch services ready for content processing.

### Data Models
**Enhanced NASA API Data Structure:**
- **Daily API Response:** Existing structure preserved
- **RSS Feed Data Structure:**
  - `title` (String) - APOD title
  - `description` (String) - APOD explanation
  - `link` (String) - APOD URL
  - `pubDate` (String) - Publication date
  - `enclosure` (Object) - Image/video URL and metadata
  - `guid` (String) - Unique identifier

**API Integration Patterns:**
- **Primary Source:** NASA API for daily content
- **Secondary Source:** RSS feed for historical content
- **Fallback Strategy:** Cached content when APIs are unavailable

### API Specifications
**NASA API Endpoints:**
- **Daily APOD:** `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={key}&date={date}`
- **Today's APOD:** `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={key}`
- **RSS Feed:** `https://apod.com/feed.rss`

**Enhanced API Integration:**
- **Rate Limiting:** 1000 requests per hour (NASA API limit)
- **Retry Logic:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per request
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with cached content

### Component Specifications
**Enhanced Components:**
- **Existing:** `lib/nasa.ts` - Enhanced with RSS feed integration
- **New:** `lib/rss-parser.ts` - RSS feed parsing functionality
- **Enhanced:** `lib/error-handler.ts` - Comprehensive error handling
- **New:** `lib/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting implementation

### File Locations
Based on the architecture document, the following files will be created/modified:
- `lib/nasa.ts` - Enhanced existing NASA API integration
- `lib/rss-parser.ts` - New RSS feed parsing functionality
- `lib/error-handler.ts` - New error handling utilities
- `lib/rate-limiter.ts` - New rate limiting implementation
- `lib/content-fetcher.ts` - New unified content fetching service
- `tests/lib/nasa.test.ts` - Enhanced NASA API tests
- `tests/lib/rss-parser.test.ts` - New RSS parser tests
- `docs/api-integration.md` - API integration documentation

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test File Location:** `tests/lib/` directory for API integration tests
- **Test Standards:** Unit tests for API functions, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit testing, API mocking for integration tests
- **Specific Testing Requirements:**
  - Test existing NASA API integration functionality
  - Test RSS feed parsing and data extraction
  - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Test rate limiting functionality
  - Test content fetching for both daily and historical data
  - Test frontend compatibility and performance

### Technical Constraints
- **Backward Compatibility:** Must preserve all existing frontend functionality
- **Performance:** Must maintain existing page load times
- **API Limits:** Must respect NASA API rate limits (1000 requests/hour)
- **Error Handling:** Must provide graceful degradation for API failures
- **Data Quality:** Must validate and clean fetched content

## Testing
### Required Testing Approach
Unit testing for API functions, integration testing for API endpoints, and frontend compatibility testing.

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Existing NASA API integration functionality preservation
2. RSS feed parsing and data extraction accuracy
3. Error handling and fallback mechanism effectiveness
4. Rate limiting functionality and API limit compliance
5. Content fetching for both daily and historical data
6. Frontend compatibility and performance maintenance

### Success Criteria
- All existing NASA API functionality remains intact
- RSS feed integration successfully fetches historical content
- Error handling provides graceful degradation for API failures
- Rate limiting prevents API limit violations
- Content fetching works reliably for both daily and historical data
- Frontend performance and functionality are maintained
- All tests pass with comprehensive coverage

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test API integration under various failure scenarios
- Validate RSS feed parsing accuracy and data quality
- Test rate limiting under high request volumes
- Verify frontend compatibility across different browsers
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Validate content quality and data integrity
