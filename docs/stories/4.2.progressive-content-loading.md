  - `estimatedTimeRemaining` (Number) - Estimated time remaining in seconds
  - `loadingError` (String) - Loading error message if any

- **Content Loading Priority:**
  - `priority` (Number) - Loading priority (1-5, 1 being highest)
  - `contentType` (String) - Content type to load
  - `dependencies` (Array) - Content dependencies
  - `estimatedSize` (Number) - Estimated content size in bytes
  - `loadTime` (Number) - Estimated load time in milliseconds

**Progressive Loading Configuration:**
- **Loading Strategy:**
  - `initialLoadStrategy` (String) - "immediate", "lazy", "on-demand"
  - `backgroundLoading` (Boolean) - Enable background loading
  - `preloadThreshold` (Number) - Preload threshold in viewport percentage
  - `maxConcurrentLoads` (Number) - Maximum concurrent content loads
  - `retryAttempts` (Number) - Number of retry attempts for failed loads

### API Specifications
**Progressive Loading API:**
- **Content Loading:**
  - `loadEnhancedContent(apodDate, priority)` - Load enhanced content with priority
  - `preloadContent(apodDate)` - Preload content for future display
  - `cancelContentLoad(apodDate)` - Cancel ongoing content load
  - `getLoadingStatus(apodDate)` - Get current loading status

- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - `trackPageLoadTime()` - Track initial page load time
  - `trackContentLoadTime(contentType)` - Track content load time
  - `getPerformanceMetrics()` - Get performance metrics
  - `reportPerformanceIssue(issue)` - Report performance issues

### Component Specifications
**Progressive Loading Components:**
- **ProgressiveLoader:** Main component for managing progressive loading
