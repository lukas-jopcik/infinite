  - `REGION` - AWS region (eu-central-1)

**S3 Bucket Configuration:**
- **Bucket Name:** `infinite-nasa-apod-images-{random-suffix}`
- **Region:** eu-central-1
- **Versioning:** Enabled
- **Lifecycle Policy:** 30-day transition to IA, 90-day transition to Glacier

### Component Specifications
No frontend components are created in this story. This story focuses on AWS infrastructure setup.

### File Locations
Based on the architecture document, the following files will be created:
- `aws/lambda/content-processor/index.js` - Lambda function code
- `aws/lambda/content-processor/package.json` - Lambda dependencies
- `aws/infrastructure/cloudformation/lambda.yaml` - Lambda CloudFormation template
- `aws/infrastructure/cloudformation/dynamodb.yaml` - DynamoDB CloudFormation template
- `aws/infrastructure/cloudformation/s3.yaml` - S3 CloudFormation template
- `aws/infrastructure/cloudformation/cloudwatch.yaml` - CloudWatch CloudFormation template
- `scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh` - Infrastructure deployment script
- `docs/infrastructure-setup.md` - Infrastructure setup documentation

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test File Location:** `tests/aws/infrastructure/` directory for infrastructure tests
- **Test Standards:** Infrastructure validation tests using AWS CLI commands and CloudFormation validation
- **Testing Frameworks:** AWS CLI validation, CloudFormation template validation, infrastructure testing
- **Specific Testing Requirements:**
  - Verify Lambda function deployment and invocation
  - Validate DynamoDB table creation and operations
  - Test S3 bucket creation and permissions
  - Verify CloudWatch logging configuration
  - Test regional performance and latency
  - Validate infrastructure through AWS console

### Technical Constraints
- **AWS Region:** Must use eu-central-1 (Europe - Frankfurt) for all infrastructure
- **Cost Optimization:** Must stay within AWS free-tier limits where possible
- **Security:** Must implement least-privilege access for all resources
- **Performance:** Must optimize for Slovakia location performance
- **Compliance:** Must ensure GDPR compliance for EU region deployment

## Testing
### Required Testing Approach
Infrastructure validation testing using AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation template validation, and performance testing.

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Lambda function deployment and invocation testing
2. DynamoDB table creation and basic operations
3. S3 bucket creation and permissions validation
4. CloudWatch logging configuration and functionality
5. Regional performance testing from Slovakia location
6. End-to-end infrastructure functionality testing

### Success Criteria
- All AWS services are successfully created in eu-central-1 region
- Lambda function can be invoked and responds correctly
- DynamoDB table supports basic CRUD operations
- S3 bucket allows proper image storage and retrieval
- CloudWatch logging captures Lambda function execution
- Regional performance meets requirements for Slovakia users
- All infrastructure is accessible through AWS console

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test infrastructure performance from Slovakia location
- Validate GDPR compliance for EU region deployment
- Verify cost optimization within free-tier limits
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- Validate security policies and access control
