# Story 1.2: AWS CLI Setup and Configuration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure AWS CLI with proper credentials and environment setup,
**so that** I can deploy and manage AWS infrastructure for the project.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AWS CLI is installed and configured with appropriate credentials
2. AWS CLI can successfully authenticate and list available services in eu-central-1 region
3. Environment variables are properly configured for development, staging, and production
4. AWS CLI configuration is documented for team members
5. Basic AWS service access is verified (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch) in the correct region

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: AWS CLI Installation and Basic Configuration (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Install AWS CLI v2 if not already installed
  - [ ] Configure AWS CLI with project credentials
  - [ ] Set default region to eu-central-1
  - [ ] Test authentication with `aws sts get-caller-identity`
  - [ ] Verify region access with `aws ec2 describe-regions --region eu-central-1`
- [ ] Task 2: Environment Configuration Setup (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create development environment configuration
  - [ ] Create staging environment configuration
  - [ ] Create production environment configuration
  - [ ] Configure environment-specific AWS profiles
  - [ ] Test environment switching functionality
- [ ] Task 3: AWS Service Access Verification (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test Lambda service access in eu-central-1 region
  - [ ] Test DynamoDB service access in eu-central-1 region
  - [ ] Test S3 service access in eu-central-1 region
  - [ ] Test CloudWatch service access in eu-central-1 region
  - [ ] Document service access verification results
- [ ] Task 4: Configuration Documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Document AWS CLI installation process
  - [ ] Document credential configuration steps
  - [ ] Document environment setup procedures
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - [ ] Document team member onboarding process

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** AWS project has been created with eu-central-1 region selection. IAM roles and policies are established. Billing alerts are configured. The foundation is ready for CLI configuration.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this story as it focuses on AWS CLI configuration.

### API Specifications
**AWS CLI Commands to Implement:**
- `aws configure` - Basic CLI configuration
- `aws sts get-caller-identity` - Authentication verification
- `aws ec2 describe-regions` - Region access verification
- `aws lambda list-functions` - Lambda service access test
- `aws dynamodb list-tables` - DynamoDB service access test
- `aws s3 ls` - S3 service access test
- `aws logs describe-log-groups` - CloudWatch service access test

### Component Specifications
No frontend components are created in this story. This story focuses on AWS CLI configuration and environment setup.

### File Locations
Based on the architecture document, the following files will be created:
- `aws/config/environments/development.yaml` - Development environment configuration
- `aws/config/environments/staging.yaml` - Staging environment configuration
- `aws/config/environments/production.yaml` - Production environment configuration
- `docs/aws-cli-setup.md` - AWS CLI setup documentation
- `docs/environment-configuration.md` - Environment configuration guide
- `scripts/verify-aws-access.sh` - AWS service access verification script

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test File Location:** `tests/aws/cli/` directory for AWS CLI configuration tests
- **Test Standards:** CLI command validation and service access verification
- **Testing Frameworks:** AWS CLI command testing, shell script validation
- **Specific Testing Requirements:**
  - Verify AWS CLI authentication works across all environments
  - Validate region configuration is correct for all environments
  - Test AWS service access for Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
  - Verify environment switching functionality
  - Test credential management and security

### Technical Constraints
- **AWS Region:** Must use eu-central-1 (Europe - Frankfurt) for all environments
- **Security:** Credentials must be stored securely using AWS CLI best practices
- **Environment Separation:** Clear separation between development, staging, and production
- **Documentation:** All configuration must be documented for team members
- **Compliance:** Must ensure GDPR compliance for EU region deployment

### Architecture References
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment] - AWS CLI integration strategy
[Source: architecture.md#infrastructure-and-deployment-integration] - Environment configuration approach
[Source: architecture.md#security-integration] - Credential management and security requirements

## Testing
### Required Testing Approach
AWS CLI command validation and service access verification testing using shell scripts and CLI commands.

### Key Test Scenarios
1. AWS CLI authentication verification across all environments
2. Region configuration validation for eu-central-1
3. AWS service access testing (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch)
4. Environment switching functionality
5. Credential security and management

### Success Criteria
- AWS CLI successfully authenticates in all environments
- All AWS services are accessible in eu-central-1 region
- Environment switching works correctly
- Credentials are stored securely
- Documentation is complete and accurate

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test credential security and access control
- Validate environment isolation
- Verify region performance from Slovakia location
- Test error handling for authentication failures
- Validate service permissions and access levels
