# Infinite - Slovak NASA APOD Website Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Launch a Slovak-language NASA APOD website that enhances brief English descriptions with AI-generated comprehensive articles
- Establish daily automated content delivery system that fetches NASA APOD data and processes it through AI enhancement
- Create an educational astronomy platform that makes space science accessible to Slovak-speaking audiences
- Build a modern, responsive web experience with optimal performance and SEO optimization
- Achieve 1,000 unique monthly visitors within 6 months and establish consistent daily content delivery
- Generate positive user engagement with AI-enhanced content and build email subscriber base of 500 users within 1 year

### Background Context

The Slovak-speaking astronomy community lacks access to high-quality, detailed astronomy content in their native language. NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) provides stunning daily space imagery but with brief, technical descriptions in English only. This language barrier prevents many Slovak speakers from fully appreciating NASA's educational content and limits the development of scientific literacy in Slovakia.

The solution leverages existing NASA content through their API and RSS feed, then enhances it with AI-generated Slovak articles that go beyond simple translation to create engaging, educational content. This approach addresses the language accessibility gap while building on proven content (NASA's daily imagery) and modern web technologies (Next.js frontend, AWS backend) to create a scalable platform for Slovak astronomy education.
